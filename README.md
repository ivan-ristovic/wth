### Q: What the hell is this? (no pun intended)

This is an application that uses open source APIs [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api/weathermaps) and [CartoCDN](https://github.com/CartoDB/basemap-styles) to show weather information. These APIs return images in tiles, hence the title of this project.

The application is written **entirely** in Haskell using [Gloss](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss).
